# Python-Movie-Website

This is a simple website that lists some of my favorite movies including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL.

## Description
It takes input from the user - the number of movies to show on the web page (max 20). Then it takes the movie `titles` one by one and fetches the `movie poster URL` and `movie trailer URL` using OMDB API and Youtube DOM parsing respectively. Once all the information is fetched, it shows all the movies on the web page.

## Usage

Take a clone of this repository and go to the cloned directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shunwhyeloh/Python-Movie-Website.git
```

Run app.py
```bash
python app.py
```
